## I. What is a Status Page?

This is the page where you can check the current operation status of services related to Sina-chan.

The status page is updated when a failure or maintenance is carried out, and serves to inform users of the status.

## II. Receiving Notifications

You can receive notifications on the status page in the following ways

- Email
- Twitter
- RSS

You can also receive the same notifications on the <a href="{{site.url}}/discord" class="a-orange">support server (Discord)</a>.

## III. Fault Level

The status page is classified into the following levels based on the severity of the failure and the scope of the impact.

- None (Alert Level 1): Mainly used for notifications, etc.
- Minor (Alert Level 2): Used for minor failures (performance degradation, etc.)
- Major (Alert Level 3 or 4): Used for medium-scale failures (e.g., system down)
- Critical (Alert Level 5) Used for major failures

This level will be posted at the time of all failure information announcements.

Level classification is determined at the time of a basic failure and will not be changed, but the level may be raised depending on the investigation.
